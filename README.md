# c-learning

Greetings!

Here is my little journey learning c. I have some experience in a number of languages but I've never really sat down to learn a true low level programming language.
Before this, I've only ever learned python and java. Recently, I've started learning go and c. I don't know how much I'm going to contribute to this,
but I thought I'd put it out here :)
